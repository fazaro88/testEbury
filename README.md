# Setup 

- Run 'npm install' to install modules and libraries.
- Run 'npm start' or 'ng serve'

# Front-end task: Email composer

# What do you have to build

An application for composing emails. It has to contain fields for entering the recipients, the subject and
the body of the email. It also has to be possible to attach images to the email. The application will not
actually send any email at all.

# Requirements

- The component has to be built using only HTML, CSS and JS.
- Include documentation explaining how to run the project (see the ‘How to submit our task’
section below).
- The component must look like the attached mockups (see the ‘Mockups’ section below). Try to
follow a ‘pixel perfect’ philosophy.
- The component has to be rendered correctly in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet
Explorer 11, Edge and Safari.
- You have to use pre-processors for building the CSS files (i.e. SASS, LESS, …).

# Allowed tools

- You can use CSS framework (i.e. Bootstrap, Material Design, Foundation, etc.).
- You can use vanilla javascript but you will get extra points if you use a modern framework such
as Vue, React, Marionette, etc.
- You can use trans-compilers for building the JS files (i.e. Coffeescript, Typescript, etc.).
- You can write your JS files following the ECMAScript 2015 standard, but you have to use a
compiler (i.e. Babel) for generating the distributable code.
- You can use any tool for bundling your code (i.e. Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
- You can use any task runner like gulp or Grunt.
